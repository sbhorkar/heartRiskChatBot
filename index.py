ASCVD: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, defined as coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or fatal or nonfatal stroke

Lifetime ASCVD Risk:

Estimates of lifetime risk for ASCVD are provided for adults 20 through 59 years of age and are shown as the lifetime risk for ASCVD for a 50-year-old without 
ASCVD who has the risk factor values entered at the initial visit. Because the primary use of these lifetime risk estimates is to facilitate the very important discussion 
regarding risk reduction through lifestyle change, the imprecision introduced is small enough to justify proceeding with lifestyle change counseling informed by these results.
